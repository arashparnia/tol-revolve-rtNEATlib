	// TRAIT: A Trait is a group of parameters that can be expressed     
	//        as a group more than one time.  Traits save a genetic      
	//        algorithm from having to search vast parameter landscapes  
	//        on every node.  Instead, each node can simply point to a trait 
	//        and those traits can evolve on their own 
	class Trait {

		// The following parameters are for use in    
		//   neurons that learn through habituation,
		//   sensitization, or Hebbian-type processes
